Basic-Python-RESTful-Server
===========================

A basic python RESTful Server in Flask integrated with Luminoso Python Client.

## Problem to solve

We had an issue in that our web application was developed in PHP and that we had a new requirement in interfacing our web application with the Luminoso API. Luminoso have a Python Client to do the authentication with their server.

## How we solved it

We decide to create a basic python RESTful server and include the Luminoso Python client library in the calls.

## Requirements

1. Flask micro framework - http://flask.pocoo.org/
2. Luminoso python client - https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/luminoso-api-client-python
